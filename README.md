Program Synthesis - basic principles, I'm also doing small practice projects to get the intuitions behind it\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Racket language - I have no original takes :D I just like the philosopy behind Lisp: programs writing programs. The syntax is beautiful - the fact that you can *extract* each component into smaller function and then combine them all back together in one sentence that just makes sense - there's something elegant in it. And helps me stay more precise and organized with my writing. I also have a strong conviction that the architecture of the future systems will be quite similar to what Lisp languages represent. I feel like all the rules and restrictions we impose on ourselves in many languages (poor meta-programming support) is sort of reflecting our general fear of the unknown - we seek answers to common problems, we focus on what is relevant by the standards of the group. What we end up with is our understanding of the local problems becomes better, we build a taste for what is essential and what is not, but as a result we lose the tempo as a collective, because we do not have time to explore and innovate. Instead we wanna improve, because by the standards of the group there is soo much to be found here. And so we participate in this *gold rush*. Some will get rich, others unsatisfied, yet others will get vericose veins. We live in a context that becomes the more pronounced the more we get stack in it. So with time all the less liked ideas are disregarded. Lisp puts one into a state where one is forced to look at things differently, therefore removing oneself from that context, at least to some extend. Well, I think the problem with *gold rush* in particular is not that it's pointless - it obviously isn't. The problem is it creates a cristalized state of the knowledge that is highly biased towards what has been spoken. Once an idea becomes popular, it becomes difficult to keep diversity of thought. Imagine someone came on the earth and started teaching about this amazing world out there where you can get to simply by following certain rules. Some people would think it's silly, others would take it seriously. What matters is that it takes just few people (how about 12?) to persuade people living up to 2000 years later that it's not just an idea, but in fact this is truth. We should be confident and obsessed when following our local objectives, but I think we should be also more... inquisitive individually about our convictions and carefully consider what we hear, what we see - including the voices coming from inside, for they're just echo's of the world.\
